# Spells

You can set up to three spells on your character.

We want you to have ownership over your magic, and as such we are allowing you to write your own spells to add personal RP flare. The spells can be any combination of the following:

'Defensive type spell' - This will be useful in FS3 combat, as you will get to 'wear' the armor you've cast depending on the strength of your cast. We recommend only one spell devoted to defensive armor, as they will all operate the same way!

'Offensive type spell' - This will be useful in FS3 combat, as you will get to use this offensive battle spell as your weapon. If you are a military-based character, for RP flavor within combat you may wish to have two offensive spells, but both will use the same weapon stats, so the second is purely for your enjoyment!

'World type spell' - This will be useful in RP, as you will get to cast your spell in the world and affect the course of the RP. These you can cast freely within RP.

`spells <name>` - Lists spells for a character.
`spell/set <title - type>=<description>` - Sets a spell.
`spell/remove <title - type>` - Removes a spell.

Admins with the `manage\_apps` permission can set other peoples' spells:

`spell/remove <name>=<title>`
`spell/set <name>=<title>/<description>`
